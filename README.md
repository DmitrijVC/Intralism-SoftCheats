Intralism bot for ~~grinding exp and items, or~~ beating records. 

## Usage
- Paste the map config into `config.json`
- Run `main.py`
- When in game, press `[Enter]` when you will see the first arc
- Wait for the end of the level or press `[Esc]` to stop



## Info
I am still not contented with my code, but for certain reasons I won't add auto config loader function, that would decrypt and load map config file on runtime when player starts the level. <br>
*[See Disclaimer](https://github.com/DmitrijVC/Intralism-SoftCheats#disclaimer)*

Also I will probably create a Rust version soon that will be more advanced.

## Disclaimer 
I won't upload the decryption method for map config files due to my respect towards the developers of this game <br>
and the fact that it's just my side project made 4 fun. <br>
But I am pretty sure You can find something on the internet.
